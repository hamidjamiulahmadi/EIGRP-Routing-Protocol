<h1>EIGRP Routing Protocol</h1>

<h2>Goal</h2>
<br />In this lab, I will configure the Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) to establish connectivity between the Frankfurt customer branch and the Berlin sales branch. To achieve this, I will utilize five Cisco routers, two switches, two PCs, and two laptops. The first step involves configuring each router with its respective interfaces, followed by assigning IP addresses to the PCs and laptops. Next, I will implement the EIGRP protocol on each router, defining the networks for each interface. Finally, I will conduct thorough testing to ensure the proper functionality of the entire setup.

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Packet Tracer</b> 
- <b>Windows 11</b>

<h2>Lab walk-through:</h2>
Step Nr.1: first step, i will design the Network diagram to have a better overview over the Process and hot it would be done.
